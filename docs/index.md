### Mission:
We aim to be the discussion focal point for UBI implementation globally.

### Why we are here?
This site will not discuss if Universal Basic Income (UBI) is the best solution for your country... Google that.  This site is intended for those already committed to implementing UBI and looking for information on how to move forward.  The site will allow intellectuals in the UBI space to collaborate, contribute and share best practices for UBI implementation, as a group to the world. If that sounds like you, welcome!
